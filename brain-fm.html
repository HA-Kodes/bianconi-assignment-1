          <h3>Patented Technology</h3>
          <p>Brain.fm holds patents on key processes for creating functional music, including technology to elicit
            <b>strong
              neural phase locking</b>-allowing populations of neurons to engage in various kinds of coordinated
            activity-and
            technology to remove distration in sound.
          </p>
          <p>This makes our music unique, purpose-built to steer you into a desired mental state. In other words, we've
            found new ways to create music that helps you do what you need to do.</p>

          <h3>Tested on Brain and Behavior</h3>
          <p>Scientists at Brain.fm work with collaborators at academic institutions to run experiments.</p>
          <p>We look at the effects of our technology on the brain, using fMRI and EEG, and also run large-scale
            behavioral tests, measuring performance on simple games.</p>
          <p><b>Our experiments always include a control condition ('placebo')</b> of the same underlying music without
            Brain.fm
            technology applied, so we can be sure our tech is what makes the difference.</p>
